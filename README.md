# Tensor_Network_Methods
Various tensor network methods for solving many-body physics problems. The focus is on the Bose-Hubbard model with conserved particle number (Global U(1) symmetry).

Open the "Examples" folder and open file to begin. 
"Trial_Example.m" runs a TEBD algorithm for a simple 1D lattice.

“Runga_Kutta_Trial_Example.m” runs a Runga-Kutta algorithm for a simple 1D lattice.

“TDVP_2s_Trial_Example.m” runs a 2-site TDVP algorithm for a simple 1D lattice.

“DMRG_2s_Trial_Example.m” runs a 2-site DMRG algorithm for a simple 1D lattice.

“DMRG_Trial_Example.m” runs a single-site DMRG algorithm for a simple 1D lattice.

“TDVP_Trial_Example.m” runs a single-site TDVP algorithm for a simple 1D lattice. However, this does not work… I am not sure why…
